Statsd Middleware for Go-Json-Rest
==================================

*Currently not used in production, API subject to change*

This is a middleware for [Go-Json-Rest](https://github.com/ant0ine/go-json-rest).
It uses [g2s](https://github.com/peterbourgon/g2s) to send statistics about the current request/response to a statsd server.
It depends on `rest.TimerMiddleware` and `rest.RecorderMiddleware` that should be in the wrapped middlewares.

The two metrics are in the form:
* `[<Prefix>.]response.status_code.<StatusCode>`: Counter.
* `[<Prefix>.]response.elasped_time`: Timer.
